<h1>Forward List </h1>
<hr>
<i> <br> A forward list, also known as a singly linked list, is a type of container in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) that stores a sequence of elements. 
It is called a "forward" list because it only allows forward traversal through the elements. </i>

<hr>
<b>
In a forward list, each element is stored as a node containing two members: a value and a pointer to the next node. The first node in the list is called the "head" node, and the last node has a null pointer as its "next" member. 
The forward list can be empty, in which case the head node is also a null pointer. </b>
<hr>

If you want to compile this code.
You must write

```
g++ -std=c++2a main.cpp forwardlist.cpp

```

and then if you want to run this code you must write

```
./a.out 

```
